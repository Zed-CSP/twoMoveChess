# Coding Challenge

**Welcome to your AI Solutions Engineer challenge!** 🚀

Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to **build a working web application** where users can play an exciting twist on chess we call **“Two-Move Chess.”** This is a special chess variant that puts a cool spin on classic chess strategy.

## What You’ll Build

- A **web app** playable by at least one user, or two player (take turns) if that’s easier.
- The game logic will be chess with one unique twist:
    
    **If you capture an opponent’s piece, the opponent gets two moves on their turn, but never more than two consecutive moves per player, even if two pieces are captured in a turn, their opponent will only get two moves.**
    
- The game ends when a king is captured or checkmated.
- The app should be **deployed online** (any free/low-cost service is fine; we’ll reimburse up to $10 for hosting costs).
    - Use this virtual card for expenses incurred:
